## Predicting-Employee-Attrition
### Objective
Prepare a model for the HR department to predict the Attrition and give the insights from the data
about the important factors associated with the attrition so that HR can take the corrective or
previntive measures to stop or control the attrition.
### Project Description
The dataset consists of 2940 observations and 35 features. I have performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis by using python to gain some insights from the data. To build the Machine Learning Model, I have used 
Classification and Regression Tree(CART) and Random Forest Classifier algorithms.
